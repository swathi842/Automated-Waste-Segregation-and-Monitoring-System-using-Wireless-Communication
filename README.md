This project focuses on automating the waste segregation process using sensor-based embedded technology. The system identifies and classifies waste into metallic, wet, and dry categories through a set of sensors and actuators integrated with an Arduino Uno microcontroller. It aims to reduce human involvement in waste handling, improve recycling efficiency, and promote smart waste management.
